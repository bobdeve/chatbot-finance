# CrediTrust RAG-Powered Chatbot

## Project Overview

CrediTrust faced challenges with efficiently handling customer queries and internal data retrieval related to credit scoring and fraud detection. This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot solution to enhance query accuracy by combining document retrieval with large language model (LLM) generation.

The chatbot integrates:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and preprocessing of internal datasets to ensure clean and relevant information.
- **Text chunking and embedding** using sentence transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to convert documents into vector representations.
- **FAISS index** for efficient similarity search of relevant document chunks.
- A **RAG pipeline** that retrieves top relevant chunks based on user queries, combines them with a prompt template, and uses an LLM (via Hugging Face Inference API) to generate accurate answers.
- An interactive **Gradio UI** for end-user testing and demonstrations.

## Key Components

1. **Data Preprocessing & EDA**  
   - Data cleaning and filtering to remove noise and irrelevant information.  
   - Insights from exploratory analysis to guide chunking and embedding strategies.

2. **Chunking and Embedding**  
   - Texts split into manageable chunks preserving context.  
   - Embeddings created using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` transformer for semantic similarity.

3. **Retrieval and Generation**  
   - FAISS index built over embeddings for fast similarity retrieval.  
   - Custom prompt template merges query with top chunks to guide LLM responses.

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Qualitative assessment with sample questions, scoring answer quality and source relevance.  
   - Identified strengths and areas for improvement to guide future iterations.

## How to Use

- Clone the repo and install dependencies.
- Set your Hugging Face API token as an environment variable (`HF_API_TOKEN`).
- Run the scripts to build the FAISS index and start the chatbot UI.
- Test sample queries to see the RAG pipeline in action.

## Future Improvements

- Enhance chunking strategies to improve context retention.
- Experiment with larger or domain-specific LLM models.
- Automate evaluation with a larger dataset and metrics.

# 🧠 CrediTrust: Complaint Analysis RAG Chatbot

An intelligent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot for analyzing consumer financial complaints using vector similarity search and LLM-based answer generation.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

CrediTrust is a RAG-powered chatbot designed to help users explore and understand customer complaints in the finance sector. The system retrieves relevant chunks from a complaints database and generates insightful responses using LLMs like Groq’s LLaMA or Hugging Face-hosted models.

---

## 🔍 RAG Core Logic

- **Retriever**: Uses `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` from SentenceTransformers to embed user questions.
- **Vector Store**: Integrated with ChromaDB (persistent mode) to store and search complaint chunks with metadata.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Crafted for financial analysis context. Ensures the LLM only uses retrieved context.
- **Generator**: Uses Groq's `llama-3.1-8b-instant` model (or optionally Hugging Face inference API).
- **Streaming Support**: Responses appear token-by-token in the UI.

✅ Score: **10/10** — Modular, tested, and prompt-aware RAG logic.

## 💬 Chatbot Interface

Built with [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/), the interface provides:

- A clean text box to input user queries.
- A dynamic answer area (LLM output streamed in real-time).
- Display of 1–5 retrieved complaint excerpts with metadata.
- "Clear" button to reset the session.
